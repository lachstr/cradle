    "Aim: Replicate Newton's Cradle by Creating Animations with ```matplotlib```\n",
    "\n",
    "Questions to answer;\n",
    "\n",
    "- Does Newtonian mechanics reflect the true motion of this system?\n",
    "- How does the number of displaced pendulums effect the behavoir of the system?\n",
    "- What issues arise when using python to model physics situations?\n",
    "\n",
    "*Newton's cradle can be modelled as mutilple pendulums confined to swing along a single axis which undergo elastic collisions with one another. The pendulums rest such that there is a small amount of horizontal displacement between them.*\n",

    "\n",
    "### Milestones (achieved in the following order)\n",
    " - (1)\n",
    " - Develop a this outline\n",
    " - Devise a mathematical framework to model the system\n",
    " - Use the single pendulum class as a starting point, use it to replicate the lab results in ```matplotlib```\n",
    " - (2)\n",
    " - Add two pendulums swinging simultaneously on the same plot\n",
    " - Check for collisions, conserving energy and momentum if one occurs.\n",
    " - Add more pendulums to the system, 3, 4, 5, 6 ... n?\n",
    " - (3)\n",
    " - Try to replicate the results seen with the desk toy\n",
    " - (4)\n",
    " - Write up report on the results\n",
    " - Submit animations to the 'Newton's Cradle' Wikipedia page\n",
    "\n",
    "### Extentions:\n",
    "- Add frictional losses upon collisions\n",
    "- Update kinematic equations for non-equal masses\n",
    "- Complete a full revolution with the two pendulum system.\n",
    "- Compute potential and kinetic energy at all times, plotting it too.\n",
